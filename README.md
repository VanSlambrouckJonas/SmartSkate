# SmartSkate
Hi there, My name is Jonas and I am a student Multimedia & Creative Technologies at Howest. This is a repo of my final project of the year. All of the instructions are listed in my instructable(https://www.instructables.com/SmartSkate/).

Just download the iso file and put it on your raspberry pi 4. edit the wifi config and the programm will work.
