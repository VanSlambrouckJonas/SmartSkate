# SmartSkate
Hi there, My name is Jonas and I am a student Multimedia & Creative Technologies at Howest. This is a repo of my final project of the year. All of the instructions are listed in my instructable(https://www.instructables.com/SmartSkate/).

**step 1**: Download the iso file and put it on your raspberry pi 4.

**step 2**: Power on the raspberry and plug in an ethernet cable.

**step 3**: Edit the wifi config file via Putty(for this you will need the ip of your raspberry).

**step 3**: Clone my repo.

**step 4**: Type this in the commandline 'sudo pip3 install adafruit_ssd1306'.

**step 5**: After these steps you'll need to make a service so your program will start up after powering on the raspberry.



If all of these steps are followed correctly you'll have an nice automatic longboard :).
